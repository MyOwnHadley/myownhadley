# MyOwnHadley

**A Cursor-style AI Coding Agent for RStudio**

MyOwnHadley is a comprehensive AI-powered coding agent that seamlessly integrates as an RStudio extension, bringing state-of-the-art AI capabilities directly to R developers through an autonomous agent-based approach.

## üöÄ Features

- **ü§ñ Autonomous AI Agent**: True coding agent that automatically selects and executes appropriate tools based on natural language requests
- **üí¨ Integrated Chat Interface**: Familiar Shiny-based chat experience directly in RStudio
- **üîß Comprehensive Toolkit**: Complete set of development tools including file operations, code execution, and project management
- **üéØ Context Awareness**: Automatically detects project structure, active files, and working directory
- **‚ö° Multi-step Workflows**: Handles complex tasks like "Build a Shiny app that visualizes my dataset" through intelligent tool orchestration
- **üîç Code Analysis**: Read, analyze, and understand existing code to provide contextual assistance
- **‚úèÔ∏è Intelligent Editing**: Refactor, optimize, and enhance code based on natural language instructions

## üì¶ Installation

Install the development version of `{myownhadley}` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/MyOwnHadley/myownhadley) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MyOwnHadley/myownhadley")
```

## üéØ Getting Started

1. **Launch the Agent**: After installation, you can launch the agent by calling `myownhadley()` in the R console, or by opening the MyOwnHadley addin through the RStudio Addins menu:
   - Go to `Addins` > `MyOwnHadley` in RStudio
   - Or use the command palette: `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` ‚Üí "MyOwnHadley"

2. **Start Coding**: Simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:
   - "Create a function to clean this dataset"
   - "Build a ggplot visualization of the iris dataset"
   - "Refactor this code to be more efficient"
   - "Add error handling to my function"

## üí° Example Use Cases

### Data Analysis Workflow

```
"Analyze the mtcars dataset and create a comprehensive report with visualizations"
```

The agent will:

1. Load and examine the dataset
2. Generate exploratory data analysis code
3. Create meaningful visualizations
4. Compile results into a report

### Package Development

```
"Help me create a new R package for time series analysis"
```

The agent will:

1. Set up the package structure
2. Create function templates
3. Generate documentation
4. Set up testing framework

### Code Optimization

```
"Optimize this function for better performance and add proper error handling"
```

The agent will:

1. Analyze your existing code
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Add robust error handling
